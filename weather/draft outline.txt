1. Data cleaning & re-organization & normalization
	a. seperate year, month, and day into different columns
		possible approaches:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-working-with-date-and-time-using-pandas/
					(using timestamp (or whatever it's called I already forgot) as datatype)
					https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-split-strings-into-two-list-columns-using-str-split/
					(using string)
	b. add a new column indicate the season
		possible approches: based on the column of month based on the st step
	c. add a new column indicate the index
		e.g. 1950-01-01 to 2019-01-01 corresponds to 1 to (count)

	d. consider deleting the mean temp column since there are too many missing values...

2. Basic ststistics
	a. for min temp
		find the mean of min temp for every year and then graph it? / 
		find the mean of min temp for every season in every year and then graph it? (4 graphs) / 
		apply one-way Anova to compare the means among all the years
	b. for max temp 
		same

3. Linear regression	
	Apply regression for every month? (is it linear?)

4. Machine learning
	I'm still searching for periodic regression model :(
